# Action Sense: IoT-Connected Home Automation System using Deep Learning
The integration of Human Action Recognition (HAR) using OpenCV with Gesture-Based Home Automation through IoT technologies represents a cutting-edge approach to creating intelligent, responsive environments. This project harnesses computer vision capabilities and IoT to enhance user interaction with home automation systems through natural gestures and actions. HAR, a crucial aspect of modern computer vision, enables systems to understand and interpret human activities. In this endeavor, OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, forms the basis of a robust HAR system. The system is designed to detect and recognize a diverse range of human actions using the ResNet dataset for precise action recognition. Recognized actions serve as input commands for controlling various home automation functions. The gesture-based home automation system utilizes IoT technology to facilitate communication between the HAR system and household devices. Through IoT protocols and pyserial for serial communication, identified gestures are sent to a central hub that processes these commands and triggers corresponding actions in connected smart devices. This setup allows users to manage lighting, temperature, entertainment systems, and other household appliances with simple hand gestures, enhancing convenience and accessibility. This hybrid project effectively addresses key challenges in HAR and IoT, ensuring real- time performance, reliability in varied conditions, and secure communication. The system is scalable, allowing the integration of new gestures and actions as needed. Additionally, feedback mechanisms continuously refine recognition accuracy and system responsiveness. Experimental results demonstrate the HAR system's efficacy in accurately recognizing a wide range of human actions and gestures. The integration with IoT-based home automation confirms the practicality and usability of gesture-based controls in every day scenarios. User studies show high satisfaction rates, with participants praising the system's ease of use and responsiveness.
